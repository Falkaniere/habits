# Habit Tracker

## Overview

Habit Tracker is an iOS app designed to help you build and maintain habits effectively. The app allows you to add new habits, set reminders, and track your progress.

## Features

- **Notification Reminders:** Set up reminders for each habit to receive notifications at your preferred time.

- **Edit Habit:** Update the details of your habit at any time.
- **Disable Notifications:** Turn off notifications for specific habits without deleting them.
- **Delete Habit:** Remove habits that you no longer want to track.
- **Automatic List Update:** The habit list updates automatically based on the selected frequency—every 24 hours, weekly, or monthly.
